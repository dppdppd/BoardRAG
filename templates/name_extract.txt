Extract the proper board game name from this filename: "{filename}"

{context_section}

Guidelines:
- Return ONLY the official published game name with no preamble or formatting.
- Remove file-related words: "rules", "manual", "rulebook", "complete", "rework", "bw", "color", "v1", "v2".
- If an acronym, find a possible name from the PDF content.
- Use proper capitalization for official game titles.
- If you see the actual game title in the PDF content, prefer that over filename guessing.
