Roll for production  \n   • Throw both dice.  \n   • Each terrain hex whose number matches the roll produces. Every player with a settlement bordering that hex takes one matching resource card; a city collects two.  \n   • If a 7 appears, no hex produces. Instead, every player with more than seven resource cards discards half (rounded down). The active player moves the robber to any hex, steals one random resource from a player with a bordering settlement or city, and the robbed hex is blocked from producing until the robber is moved again.  \n\n2. Trade (optional, any number of times)  \n   • Domestic trade: propose exchanges with other players; the active player decides which offers to accept.  \n   • Maritime trade: swap cards with the bank at 4 : 1, 3 : 1 at a generic port you control, or 2 : 1 at a matching specialty port.  \n   • You may intermix trade and building, repeating as often as you wish while you remain the active player.  \n\n3. Build/Play development (optional, any order, any number)  \n   • Spend resources to:  \n     – build a road (brick + lumber),  \n     – build a settlement (brick + lumber + wool + grain),  \n     – upgrade a settlement to a city (3 ore + 2 grain),  \n     – buy a development card (ore + wool + grain).  \n   • You may play one previously purchased development card, resolving its effect; Victory Point cards are revealed only when they give you the win. Newly bought development cards cannot be played this turn.  \n   • Roads and buildings must obey distance, placement, and supply limits; development cards may never be traded.  \n\n4. End of turn  \n   • Return any unspent resources to your hand, pass the dice clockwise; the player to your left begins their turn.\n\n**Source:** N/A"}], "Up Front": [{"role": "user", "metadata": {"title": null}, "content": "describe wire in depth", "options": null}, {"role": "assistant", "metadata": {"title": null}, "content": "I don’t know.\n\n**Source:** N/A", "options": null}, {"role": "user", "metadata": {"title": null}, "content": "describe wire ", "options": null}, {"role": "assistant", "metadata": {"title": null}, "content": "I don't know.\n\n**Source:** N/A", "options": null}, {"role": "user", "metadata": {"title": null}, "content": "describe smoke", "options": null}, {"role": "assistant", "metadata": {"title": null}, "content": "I don’t know.\n\n**Source:** N/A", "options": null}, {"role": "user", "metadata": {"title": null}, "content": "describe the game", "options": null}, {"role": "assistant", "metadata": {"title": null}, "content": "I don’t know.\n\n**Source:** N/A", "options": null}, {"role": "user", "content": "describe the game"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I don’t know.\n\n**Source:** N/A"}], "The Campaign for North Africa": [{"role": "user", "metadata": {"title": null}, "content": "describe ground assault", "options": null}, {"role": "assistant", "metadata": {"title": null}, "content": "Ground (Close) Assault is the hand-to-hand phase of combat that occurs after artillery and anti-tank fire.  \nIt is always initiated by the phasing player and always fought between adjacent hexes.\n\n1. When and who may attack  \n   • Close Assault is the final step of the Combat Segment.  \n   • Any phasing combat unit that possesses an Offensive Close Assault Rating may assault an adjacent enemy hex unless the terrain forbids it (e.g., no motorized assault into Salt Marsh; no assault up an escarpment without first dismounting, etc.).  \n   • Each enemy-occupied hex can be assaulted only once per Combat Segment, but any number of friendly hexes may contribute to that single assault.\n\n2. Pre-assault sequence  \n   a. Position guns and armor (Front/Back).  \n   b. Execute all Barrages.  \n   c. Non-phasing units may Retreat-Before-Assault.  \n   d. Both players secretly assign each participating TOE Strength Point to one of three states: Anti-Armor, Close Assault, or Withheld.  \n   e. Resolve Anti-Armor fire and remove losses.  \n   f. Proceed to Close Assault with the surviving TOE points that were assigned to Close Assault.\n\n3. Forming the assault force  \n   • You may commit any portion of a unit’s TOE points, but if less than 50 % of a unit’s available points are used the attack is automatically a Probe, not a full Close Assault.  \n   • Tanks must be accompanied by an equal number of infantry-class TOE points from the same hex; for every 1-3 unsupported tank TOE points, one Actual Close Assault point is lost (maximum –4).  \n   • If the phasing side now has at least twice the raw Close Assault strength of the defender, the column shifts two in its favour; additional shifts apply for formal organizational size differences (company vs. battalion, battalion vs. regiment, etc.).\n\n4. Calculating the Assault Differential  \n   • Total each side’s Actual Close Assault Points (after Anti-Armor losses, Combined-Arms reductions, etc.).  \n   • Subtract defender from attacker to get the Basic Assault Differential.  \n   • Apply column shifts for:  \n     – Terrain in defender’s hex and terrain of each assault hexside (hexside effects are added to hex effects; only one hexside type may benefit the defender unless the same hexside contains two different terrain features).  \n     – Up-/down-slope or escarpment attacks (+1 attacker down-slope, –3 defender when attacker climbs an escarpment, etc.).  \n     – Morale: compare each side’s Adjusted Morale Rating and shift columns accordingly.  \n     – Size differential and special cases (all defending guns with no assault rating, all defenders pinned, etc.).\n\n5. Resolving the assault  \n   • Consult the Close Assault Combat Results Table using the final Differential column.  \n   • Both players roll two dice (read sequentially, e.g., “63”).  \n   • Cross-index the roll with the column on their own half of the table (attacker or defender) to obtain:  \n     – Percentage losses (converted to Raw Strength Point losses, then distributed proportionally among units in all involved hexes).  \n     – Captured result (a fraction of the defender’s losses become prisoners/equipment if the attacker survives).  \n     – Retreat distance (mandatory minimum; each hex not retreated costs the side an extra 10 % loss).  \n     – Engaged result (units are locked in combat until the end of the Operations Stage; leaving costs additional Capability Points).\n\n6. After-effects  \n   • Apply Vulnerability losses to forward guns and to all guns if an overrun occurred.  \n   • Place Engaged markers where required; remove them at the end of the Operations Stage.  \n   • The phasing player may now release reserves and resume movement/combat cycles if desired.\n\nKey limitations  \n• Motorized units may never assault up an escarpment; tanks may never attack alone without suffering Combined-Arms penalties.  \n• A hex that was assaulted (or probed) cannot be assaulted again in the same Combat Segment.  \n• Ammunition is automatically expended by both sides during Close Assault.\n\nGround Assault therefore combines fire preparation, secret force assignment, simultaneous anti-armor duels, and finally a differential-based, column-shifted close-quarters combat resolution that yields casualties, captures, retreats, or continuing melee (Engaged).\n\n**Source:** 📄 cna-rules-rework-complete.pdf (pages 1, 4-6, 12, 14, 19-26, 39, 50-51, 67) | 📄 cna-rules-charts-ax.pdf (page 26)", "options": null}, {"role": "user", "metadata": {"title": null}, "content": "describe pasta", "options": null}, {"role": "assistant", "metadata": {"title": null}, "content": "I don’t know.\n\n**Source:** 📄 cna-rules-rework-complete.pdf (pages 4-6, 12, 14, 18-26, 67) | 📄 cna-rules-charts.pdf (pages 0-1) | 📄 cna-rules-charts-shared.pdf (pages 0-1)", "options": null}, {"role": "user", "metadata": {"title": null}, "content": "are there any rules for pasta?", "options": null}, {"role": "assistant", "metadata": {"title": null}, "content": "There are no rules concerning pasta.\n\n**Source:** 📄 cna-rules-rework-complete.pdf (pages 1, 3-6, 9-10, 12, 18-26) | 📄 cna-rules-charts.pdf (pages 0-1) | 📄 cna-rules-charts-shared.pdf (pages 0-1)", "options": null}, {"role": "user", "metadata": {"title": null}, "content": "are there rules for tanks?", "options": null}, {"role": "assistant", "metadata": {"title": null}, "content": "Yes. Tanks are governed by a whole family of rules that cover their movement capabilities, combat strengths, vulnerability to fire, logistical demands, mechanical reliability, and even what happens after they are knocked out.\n\n1. Tank characteristics  \n   • Every tank TOE Strength Point has a printed Capability-Point Allowance (20-25), Anti-Armor rating, Offensive and Defensive Close-Assault ratings, Armor-Protection rating, Vulnerability rating, Fuel-Rate, and Breakdown Adjustment Rating. These values are listed on the national Tank & Gun Characteristics Charts and are used whenever the tank moves, fights, refuels, or checks for mechanical failure.\n\n2. Tank combat procedures  \n   a. Anti-Armor Fire (14.0)  \n      – Tanks may fire their Anti-Armor rating or be targeted by enemy Anti-Armor fire.  \n      – Incoming Damage Points are absorbed against the tank’s Armor-Protection rating; once absorbed points equal or exceed that rating, one TOE tank point is destroyed.  \n   b. Close Assault (15.0)  \n      – Tanks may contribute their Close-Assault ratings, but for each tank TOE point there must be an equal infantry-class TOE point from the same hex; otherwise the tank force suffers –1 Actual Close-Assault point per 1-3 unsupported tanks (maximum –4).  \n      – Size-of-force and morale shifts apply as normal.  \n   c. Combined sequence  \n      1. Assign TOE points (Anti-Armor / Close-Assault / Withheld).  \n      2. Resolve simultaneous Anti-Armor fire and remove tank losses.  \n      3. Apply surviving Close-Assault points, with combined-arms adjustments, to determine the Assault Differential.\n\n3. Special tank situations  \n   • Capturing Destroyed Tanks (14.5): once a tank point is eliminated, a Destroyed-Tank marker is left; if the enemy later enters that hex, he may tow the wreck three hexes and attempt repair in a facility.  \n   • Halftracks: certain Axis motorised infantry units count as “half-tracks”; if they are the only armored TOE in a hex, their Armor-Protection rating is doubled, but no more than two such points may be lost per Anti-Armor segment.  \n   • Dummy Tank Formations (16.4): each side may construct up to three battalion-sized dummy tank units that look like real tanks to enemy reconnaissance but vanish if subjected to Close Assault or Anti-Armor fire.  \n   • HQ tanks (3.35): some armoured division/brigade headquarters counters contain one TOE “platoon” of tanks that may fight only if no other combat units are attached.\n\n4. Reliability and repair  \n   • Breakdown (21.0): tanks are vehicles and may suffer mechanical failure whenever they expend CP for movement; the Breakdown Adjustment on the tank chart shifts the die roll.  \n   • Repair (22.0): broken-down tanks can be fixed in the field or at a repair facility; destroyed tanks that have been captured may be rebuilt under 22.4.  \n   • Tank Recovery Squadrons may tow immobilised tanks to repair sites.\n\n5. Logistics  \n   • Tanks consume Fuel at their printed Fuel-Rate whenever they move.  \n   • Ammunition is automatically expended whenever they fire Anti-Armor or participate in Close Assault.\n\nIn short, tanks in CNA are fully integrated into the system: they have distinct ratings, must cooperate with infantry for maximum effect, can be broken, repaired, captured, or even faked, and they form the centrepiece of both the Anti-Armor and Close-Assault subsystems.\n\n**Source:** 📄 cna-rules-rework-complete.pdf (pages 1-2, 4-6, 9-10, 12, 18-24, 26-27) | 📄 cna-rules-charts.pdf (pages 0-1, 46, 81) | 📄 cna-rules-charts-shared.pdf (pages 0-1) | 📄 cna-rules-charts-cw.pdf (page 27) | 📄 cna-rules-charts-ax.pdf (page 28)", "options": null}, {"role": "user", "metadata": {"title": null}, "content": "are there rules for foot soldiers?", "options": null}, {"role": "assistant", "metadata": {"title": null}, "content": "Yes.  “Foot soldiers” are the game’s Infantry-type units and they are covered by a full set of rules that define how they move, fight, absorb losses, and can be upgraded or motorised.\n\n1. What an Infantry-type unit is  \n   • Any counter whose ID code is listed on the Unit-Characteristics Chart as “Infantry Bn-Eq” or “Infantry Coy-Eq” is a foot unit.  \n   • One TOE Strength Point represents roughly 100-200 men.  \n   • Infantry have no Vulnerability Rating, so they cannot be harmed by Anti-Armor fire, and they possess no Armor-Protection Rating.\n\n2. Capability-Point Allowance (movement)  \n   • Basic CPA is 8–10.  \n   • A non-motorised unit may never voluntarily expend more than 150 % of that base during its portion of an Operations Stage (an 8 may spend up to 12 CP; a 10 up to 15).  \n   • If trucks are attached, the battalion becomes “motorised” and immediately uses the CPA of the truck (normally 20). If the trucks run out of fuel the men must dismount to assault (49.4).\n\n3. Terrain and assault limits  \n   • A motorised infantry unit may never assault up an escarpment and may not assault into Salt-Marsh hexes while still on its trucks; it must first dismount.  \n   • Leg infantry pay the normal CP costs shown on the Terrain Effects Chart to cross slopes, ridges, wadis, etc.\n\n4. Combat functions  \n   a. Barrage class – Infantry-class (all infantry, engineers, HQs).  \n   b. Close Assault – Every infantry point has an Offensive and Defensive Close-Assault rating (typically “2/3”).  \n   c. Combined Arms – For every TOE Strength Point of tanks taking part in a Close Assault, there must be an equal TOE Strength Point of infantry, machine-gun, or heavy-weapons from the SAME hex, otherwise the tanks lose one Actual Assault point per one-to-three unsupported tanks (max –4).  \n   d. Size Differential – If the attacker has twice the raw infantry strength of the defender, the column shifts two in the attacker’s favour. Additional shifts apply for company vs. battalion, regiment vs. brigade, etc.\n\n5. Training, morale, and upgrades  \n   • Each battalion has a Basic Morale rating (-3 to +3). Certain Commonwealth units begin below that value and must be trained up.  \n   • Infantry battalions with specific ID codes may later be “augmented” by anti-tank TOE points or receive an outright upgrade (rules 19.9, 20.77).\n\n6. Logistical factors  \n   • Infantry consume ammunition whenever they fire (50.0).  \n   • They do not consume fuel unless being carried in trucks.  \n   • They never make Breakdown checks unless mounted on vehicles.\n\n7. Stacking and attachment  \n   • An infantry battalion counts the standard number of Stacking Points shown on the Stacking Chart and may be attached, detached, or entered on a parent HQ’s log sheet like any other combat unit.\n\nIn short, foot soldiers follow all general land-movement and combat rules, plus specific provisions for their lower CPA, inability to be damaged by anti-tank fire, the need to escort tanks in Close Assault, and their optional conversion to motorised status by attaching truck points.\n\n**Source:** 📄 cna-rules-rework-complete.pdf (pages 1, 3-6, 9-10, 12, 14, 18-22, 24, 26-27, 36, 68) | 📄 cna-rules-charts-cw.pdf (pages 22, 27) | 📄 cna-rules-charts.pdf (pages 42, 45, 76, 81) | 📄 cna-rules-charts-ax.pdf (pages 24, 27)", "options": null}, {"role": "user", "content": "what about shoes?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There are no rules concerning shoes.\n\n**Source:** 📄 cna-rules-rework-complete.pdf (pages 1-2, 4-6, 9-10, 12, 14, 16-18, 22, 24, 27, 36, 68, 70) | 📄 cna-rules-charts-cw.pdf (pages 22, 25) | 📄 cna-rules-charts.pdf (pages 10, 42, 45, 76, 79) | 📄 cna-rules-charts-ax.pdf (pages 24, 27) | 📄 cna-rules-charts-shared.pdf (page 10)"}]}}
